# Pythonista-Bot

Primary Discord Bot for the Pythonista Guild!

## Setup Requirements

- [ ] Python 3.11+
- [ ] PostgreSQL 15+

You must make a valid copy of [the config file](./config.template.toml) named `config.toml`, fill in the blanks, and then...

## Running the bot

In the future we'll provide a systemd unit, pm2 config and maybe a Dockerfile for running the bot, but for now you can use your ideal terminal and:-
```shell
python bot.py
```

### Support

As this bot is not really designed for use outside of our Guild, support provided will be **very** limited.
But if you wish to chat to us, feel free to open a discussion, an issue or even a PR (for fixes and whatnot)!
